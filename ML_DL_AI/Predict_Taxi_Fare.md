*   Objective

*   -   Use BigQuery to find public datasets.
    -   Query and explore the public taxi cab dataset.
    -   Create a training and evaluation dataset to be used for batch prediction.
    -   Create a forecasting (linear regression) model in BQML.
    -   Evaluate the performance of your machine learning model.

-   Linear regression model:

-   -   Loss metric : Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

-   Benchmarking is establishing a minimum level of model performance and accuracy that is acceptable.



## Explore NYC taxi cab data

**Question:** How many trips did Yellow taxis take each month in 2015?

```sql
#standardSQL
SELECT
  TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(pickup_datetime,
    MONTH) month,
  COUNT(*) trips
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york.tlc_yellow_trips_2015`
GROUP BY
  1
ORDER BY
  1
```



**Question:** What was the average speed of Yellow taxi trips in 2015?

```sql
#standardSQL
SELECT
  EXTRACT(HOUR
  FROM
    pickup_datetime) hour,
  ROUND(AVG(trip_distance / TIMESTAMP_DIFF(dropoff_datetime,
        pickup_datetime,
        SECOND))*3600, 1) speed
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york.tlc_yellow_trips_2015`
WHERE
  trip_distance > 0
  AND fare_amount/trip_distance BETWEEN 2
  AND 10
  AND dropoff_datetime > pickup_datetime
GROUP BY
  1
ORDER BY
  1
```



## Identify an objective



Predicting the fare before the ride could be very useful for trip planning for both the rider and the taxi agency.



## Select features and create your training dataset

Dataset Reference page

*   https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/nyc-tlc-trips
*   Schema: <https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/nyc-tlc:yellow.trips?pli=1>
*   Preview: <https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/nyc-tlc:yellow.trips?tab=preview>

Create a variable params with two attributes, `TRAIN` and `Eval`, standing for two datasets.


```sql
#standardSQL
WITH params AS (
    SELECT
    1 AS TRAIN,
    2 AS EVAL
    ),

  daynames AS
    (SELECT ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tues', 'Wed', 'Thurs', 'Fri', 'Sat'] AS daysofweek),

  taxitrips AS (
  SELECT
    (tolls_amount + fare_amount) AS total_fare,
    daysofweek[ORDINAL(EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM pickup_datetime))] AS dayofweek,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM pickup_datetime) AS hourofday,
    pickup_longitude AS pickuplon,
    pickup_latitude AS pickuplat,
    dropoff_longitude AS dropofflon,
    dropoff_latitude AS dropofflat,
    passenger_count AS passengers
  FROM
    `nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`, daynames, params
  WHERE
    trip_distance > 0 AND fare_amount > 0
    AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(pickup_datetime AS STRING))),1000) = params.TRAIN
  )

  SELECT *
  FROM taxitrips
```



## Create a BigQuery dataset to store models

Steps:

*   Right-hand side, click **CREATE DATASET**.
*   `Dataset ID`: taxi, leave the other values at their defaults.
*   Click **Create datase**.



## Select a BQML model type and specify options

BQML-supposed Model Types (<https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create>)

![](./static/BQML-model-types.png)

A frame creating a BQML model. Replace the `-- paste the training dataset query here` part with the query for training dataset.

```sql
#standardSQL
CREATE or REPLACE MODEL taxi.taxifare_model
OPTIONS
  (model_type='linear_reg', labels=['total_fare']) AS
-- paste the training dataset query here
```

Create (or replace) a BQML model named `taxifare_model` under taxi dataset. The type of the model is `linear_reg` and target label is `total_fare`.

```sql
#standardSQL
CREATE or REPLACE MODEL taxi.taxifare_model
OPTIONS
  (model_type='linear_reg', labels=['total_fare']) AS

WITH params AS (
    SELECT
    1 AS TRAIN,
    2 AS EVAL
    ),

  daynames AS
    (SELECT ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tues', 'Wed', 'Thurs', 'Fri', 'Sat'] AS daysofweek),

  taxitrips AS (
  SELECT
    (tolls_amount + fare_amount) AS total_fare,
    daysofweek[ORDINAL(EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM pickup_datetime))] AS dayofweek,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM pickup_datetime) AS hourofday,
    pickup_longitude AS pickuplon,
    pickup_latitude AS pickuplat,
    dropoff_longitude AS dropofflon,
    dropoff_latitude AS dropofflat,
    passenger_count AS passengers
  FROM
    `nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`, daynames, params
  WHERE
    trip_distance > 0 AND fare_amount > 0
    AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(pickup_datetime AS STRING))),1000) = params.TRAIN
  )

  SELECT *
  FROM taxitrips
```



## Evaluate classification model performance

A linear regression model requires a Loss metric like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). In BQML, `mean_squared_error` is q queryable field when evaluating your ML model, using function `SQRT()` to get RMSE.

We use `ML.EVALUATE()` to start a evaluation on the eval dataset (by `where` command).

```sql
#standardSQL
SELECT
  # here we use SQRT() to evaluate the model we created
  SQRT(mean_squared_error) AS rmse
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL taxi.taxifare_model,
  (

  WITH params AS (
    SELECT
    1 AS TRAIN,
    2 AS EVAL
    ),

  daynames AS
    (SELECT ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tues', 'Wed', 'Thurs', 'Fri', 'Sat'] AS daysofweek),

  taxitrips AS (
  SELECT
    (tolls_amount + fare_amount) AS total_fare,
    daysofweek[ORDINAL(EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM pickup_datetime))] AS dayofweek,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM pickup_datetime) AS hourofday,
    pickup_longitude AS pickuplon,
    pickup_latitude AS pickuplat,
    dropoff_longitude AS dropofflon,
    dropoff_latitude AS dropofflat,
    passenger_count AS passengers
  FROM
    `nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`, daynames, params
  WHERE
    trip_distance > 0 AND fare_amount > 0
    # here we use evaluation data to validate the ML model
    AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(pickup_datetime AS STRING))),1000) = params.EVAL
  )

  SELECT *
  FROM taxitrips

  ))
```



## Predict taxi fare amount

Here we use `ml.predict()` to predict the taxi fare amount to the evaluation data (by `params.EVAL`).

```sql
#standardSQL
SELECT
*
FROM
  ml.PREDICT(MODEL `taxi.taxifare_model`,
   (

 WITH params AS (
    SELECT
    1 AS TRAIN,
    2 AS EVAL
    ),

  daynames AS
    (SELECT ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tues', 'Wed', 'Thurs', 'Fri', 'Sat'] AS daysofweek),

  taxitrips AS (
  SELECT
    (tolls_amount + fare_amount) AS total_fare,
    daysofweek[ORDINAL(EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM pickup_datetime))] AS dayofweek,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM pickup_datetime) AS hourofday,
    pickup_longitude AS pickuplon,
    pickup_latitude AS pickuplat,
    dropoff_longitude AS dropofflon,
    dropoff_latitude AS dropofflat,
    passenger_count AS passengers
  FROM
    `nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`, daynames, params
  WHERE
    trip_distance > 0 AND fare_amount > 0
    AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(pickup_datetime AS STRING))),1000) = params.EVAL
  )

  SELECT *
  FROM taxitrips

));
```



## Improving the model with Feature Engineering



### Filtering the training dataset

Find out outliers.

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(fare_amount) AS num_fares,
  MIN(fare_amount) AS low_fare,
  MAX(fare_amount) AS high_fare,
  AVG(fare_amount) AS avg_fare,
  STDDEV(fare_amount) AS stddev
FROM
`nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`
# 1,108,779,463 fares
```



Limit the data to avoid the outliers.

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(fare_amount) AS num_fares,
  MIN(fare_amount) AS low_fare,
  MAX(fare_amount) AS high_fare,
  AVG(fare_amount) AS avg_fare,
  STDDEV(fare_amount) AS stddev
FROM
`nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`
WHERE trip_distance > 0 AND fare_amount BETWEEN 6 and 200
# 843,834,902 fares
```



Limit the distance traveled (target the city where you are really focusing).

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(fare_amount) AS num_fares,
  MIN(fare_amount) AS low_fare,
  MAX(fare_amount) AS high_fare,
  AVG(fare_amount) AS avg_fare,
  STDDEV(fare_amount) AS stddev
FROM
`nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`
WHERE trip_distance > 0 AND fare_amount BETWEEN 6 and 200
    AND pickup_longitude > -75 #limiting of the distance the taxis travel out
    AND pickup_longitude < -73
    AND dropoff_longitude > -75
    AND dropoff_longitude < -73
    AND pickup_latitude > 40
    AND pickup_latitude < 42
    AND dropoff_latitude > 40
    AND dropoff_latitude < 42
    # 827,365,869 fares
```



### Retraining the model

We create a new model `taxifare_model_2` and retrain our linear regression model to predict total fare.

Here we calculate [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) (straight line) between the pick up and drop off coordinates.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL taxi.taxifare_model_2
OPTIONS
  (model_type='linear_reg', labels=['total_fare']) AS


WITH params AS (
    SELECT
    1 AS TRAIN,
    2 AS EVAL
    ),

  daynames AS
    (SELECT ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tues', 'Wed', 'Thurs', 'Fri', 'Sat'] AS daysofweek),

  taxitrips AS (
  SELECT
    (tolls_amount + fare_amount) AS total_fare,
    daysofweek[ORDINAL(EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM pickup_datetime))] AS dayofweek,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM pickup_datetime) AS hourofday,
    SQRT(POW((pickup_longitude - dropoff_longitude),2) + POW(( pickup_latitude - dropoff_latitude), 2)) as dist, #Euclidean distance between pickup and drop off
    SQRT(POW((pickup_longitude - dropoff_longitude),2)) as longitude, #Euclidean distance between pickup and drop off in longitude
    SQRT(POW((pickup_latitude - dropoff_latitude), 2)) as latitude, #Euclidean distance between pickup and drop off in latitude
    passenger_count AS passengers
  FROM
    `nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`, daynames, params
WHERE trip_distance > 0 AND fare_amount BETWEEN 6 and 200
    AND pickup_longitude > -75 #limiting of the distance the taxis travel out
    AND pickup_longitude < -73
    AND dropoff_longitude > -75
    AND dropoff_longitude < -73
    AND pickup_latitude > 40
    AND pickup_latitude < 42
    AND dropoff_latitude > 40
    AND dropoff_latitude < 42
    AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(pickup_datetime AS STRING))),1000) = params.TRAIN
  )

  SELECT *
  FROM taxitrips
```



### Evaluate the new model

RMSE represents the standard deviation of prediction errors. Less RMSE to errors, more accurate to the prediction. A lower RSME value usually indicates a more accurate BQML model.

```sql
SELECT
  SQRT(mean_squared_error) AS rmse
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL taxi.taxifare_model_2,
  (

  WITH params AS (
    SELECT
    1 AS TRAIN,
    2 AS EVAL
    ),

  daynames AS
    (SELECT ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tues', 'Wed', 'Thurs', 'Fri', 'Sat'] AS daysofweek),

  taxitrips AS (
  SELECT
    (tolls_amount + fare_amount) AS total_fare,
    daysofweek[ORDINAL(EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM pickup_datetime))] AS dayofweek,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM pickup_datetime) AS hourofday,
    SQRT(POW((pickup_longitude - dropoff_longitude),2) + POW(( pickup_latitude - dropoff_latitude), 2)) as dist, #Euclidean distance between pickup and drop off
    SQRT(POW((pickup_longitude - dropoff_longitude),2)) as longitude, #Euclidean distance between pickup and drop off in longitude
    SQRT(POW((pickup_latitude - dropoff_latitude), 2)) as latitude, #Euclidean distance between pickup and drop off in latitude
    passenger_count AS passengers
  FROM
    `nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`, daynames, params
WHERE trip_distance > 0 AND fare_amount BETWEEN 6 and 200
    AND pickup_longitude > -75 #limiting of the distance the taxis travel out
    AND pickup_longitude < -73
    AND dropoff_longitude > -75
    AND dropoff_longitude < -73
    AND pickup_latitude > 40
    AND pickup_latitude < 42
    AND dropoff_latitude > 40
    AND dropoff_latitude < 42
    AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(pickup_datetime AS STRING))),1000) = params.EVAL
  )

  SELECT *
  FROM taxitrips

  ))
```
